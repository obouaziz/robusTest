## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
The package depends on the Rcpp library.

This is my first submission.

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- changed the \dontrun commands to \donttest.

- added a value section to the tiebreak.Rd file.

There is currently no reference paper for the package as the companion paper has not 
yet been submitted. I plan to submit an arXiv version of the paper in a near future.
