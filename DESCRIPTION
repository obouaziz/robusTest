Description: Implementation of corrected two-sample tests. A corrected version of the Pearson and Kendall correlation tests, 
 the Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) rank sum test, the Wilcoxon signed rank test and a variance test are implemented.
 The package also proposes a test for the median and an independence test between two continuous variables of Kolmogorov-Smirnov's type. 
 All these corrected tests are asymptotically calibrated in the sense that the probability of rejection under the null hypothesis is 
 asymptotically equal to the level of the test. See <arXiv:2211.08784> for more details on the statistical tests.
